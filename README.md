Fringer_UX_Design


<h1>Brief</h1>

After seeing a presentation of a project that the Edinburgh Fringe was working on, I saw there may be an opportunity to have a
mobile version of their desktop product using most of the components they were already using.

The app would allow festival goers to easily access the events at the festival in the palm of their hand but also in a fun
and interactive way.

<h1>The Product</h1>

The mobile application shown in the pdf is my vision of how the Fringe could have an app that would allow the user to easily 
meet the criteria of the business. 

As the majority of the people that attend the fringe are younger, I thought that using a format that is familiar with them would 
allow the app to be easy to understand how it works.

1) Opening the application:

On opening the application the user would have to sign up/ log in via email or an alternative social media login. This would allow
the business to capture fringe participents details which could be leveraged in the future to promote upcoming fringe events. 

2) How to use the app:

The next three images would educate the user on how to use the app in a simple and fun interactive way. The large text is easy to read,
and the animation of the hand at the bottom which would move in the direction of the swipe required.

3) The main page:

The main page is all about dating the fringe. In the middle would display the event profile in a large format. Here would be shown the shows
title, potentially the price and potenitally the latest review, all of which the client could decide what would be best.
If the user wanted to know more information about the show, hitting the read more button would remove the "pass" and "watch" button and show more
details about the show.

Just like the dating app Tinder, the user would be able to swipe left and right to either save the show as something to watch or to pass on the show.
If the person "connected" with the show then this would be saved to their personal directory but remaining on this page the ticket symbol in the top right
would be updated with a red icon and the number of shows saved. 

The would also be a settings function that would allow the user to specify what they wanted to see. If the user only wanted to see comedies, this could be
done in the settings and would then only ever show comedies on the main profile page.

3) The main page - advertisement:

The larger main image on the main page would give apel opportunity to add advertisement. Both static images and videos would be able to render in this section allowing the buiness to gain income from ads/sponsors.

4)Connecting with the shows performer:

One aspect that got me excited was for the ability of the user to connect with performer of the show. If a user bought a ticket then soon after the show had finished, a group connection between the users who viewed the shows and the performer would open up and they would be able to directly leave reviews. 

It could narrow the gap between the audience and the front of the stage. The user would be able to have a closer connection to the perfromer and the performer would eb able to get instantaniou feedback from their audience.

4) Checking out tickets
The last image would be the page where the user could review their tickets that they have saved. Here they would be able to remove the ticket if they have changed their mind or buy the ticket itself. On pressing the buy button a drop down would show with all the dates and times that show was on. The user would select the time they wanted and then buy the ticket using the button at the bottom.
